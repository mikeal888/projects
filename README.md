# projects

This is a simple repository for simple python projects.

Also trying to get into a good habit of committing.

To commit a file:
---
git add <file>
git commit -m "<message>"
git push - u origin master
(Then type in username and password)
---

In terminal if "master?" seen on right, indicates repo is dirty.
(i.e. need to commit files)
