This is a small project with a very basic form of encryption.
It is designed to work with ubuntu termianl and only encrypts text files.

Two python functions:

encrypt.py 
# Simple encrypts the file using randomly generated numbers.
It then saves the encryption key to the keys directory. 
# TO DO: Add password to keys so only user can access. 

decrypt.py
# Decrypts a python file by looking up the specific key in keys.

keys
# Directory which contains all keys.
